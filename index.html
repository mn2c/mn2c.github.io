        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This website is started and maintained by me alone. My name is Martinn, and I'm a data analytics professional with a day job outside the real estate industry, you can view my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinnchee/" target="_blank">profile here</a>. I began this site as a weekend project with the goal of learning new skills through hands-on experience and contributing to the public with my data skills.</p>
        
        <p>I intentionally keep the site ad-free to ensure a pleasant user experience, although I do incur some costs for domain and cloud infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>If you're planning a property purchase, you may find the <a href="/mortgage-loan-calculator">Property Purchase Planner Tool</a> section useful. Unlike conventional loan calculators, this Singapore-specific property purchase planning tool allows you to effortlessly experiment with various input combinations (such as price, interest, tenure, cash/CPF, etc.) using sliders. It calculates everything in real-time, enabling you to swiftly model different financial scenarios with lightning speed!</p>
